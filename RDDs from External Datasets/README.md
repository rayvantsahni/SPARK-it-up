# RDDs from External Datasets
PySpark can easily create RDDs from files that are stored in external storage devices such as `HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)`, `Amazon S3 buckets`, etc. However, the most common method of creating RDD's is from files stored in your `local file system`. This method takes a file path and reads it as a collection of lines.
