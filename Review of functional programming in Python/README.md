# Review of functional programming in Python

* Use of lambda() with map()

*The `map()` function in Python returns a list of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.). The general syntax of map() function is `map(fun, iter)`. We can also use `lambda functions` with map(). The general syntax of map() function with lambda() is `map(lambda <agument>:<expression>, iter)`.*


* Use of lambda() with filter()

*Another function that is used extensively in Python is the `filter()` function. The filter() function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments. The general syntax of the filter() function is `filter(function, list_of_input)`. Similar to the map(), filter() can be used with `lambda() function`. The general syntax of the filter() function with lambda() is `filter(lambda <argument>:<expression>, list)`.*
