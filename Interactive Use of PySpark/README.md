# Interactive Use of PySpark

Spark comes with an interactive python shell in which PySpark is already installed in it. PySpark shell is useful for basic testing and debugging and it is quite powerful.

The most important thing to understand here is that we are not creating any SparkContext object because PySpark automatically creates the SparkContext object named `sc`, by default in the PySpark shell.
